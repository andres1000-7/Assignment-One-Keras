# AssignmentOne-Keras

## CIFAR100 Image Classification with Keras
**Setting up the environment**
All the source code was mainly edited in PyCharm and executed on [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/). To setup the environment in colab, no additional installations are needed, one must only import the necessary tensorflow and keras libraries to execute the source code. However, to edit the source code on PyCharm, the following steps were performed: 
 1. Anaconda installation for Windows was followed in
    [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)
 2. Run the command on Anaconda Prompt to create the virtual environment: `conda create -n reu2023 python=3.10 anaconda`
 3. Run `conda install tensorflow` and `conda install -c conda-forge keras` to intall the packages.

**Executing the source code**
The source code is a single .py file that performs the assignment tasks.
